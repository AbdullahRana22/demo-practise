    <p>Pakistan is the site of several ancient cultures, including the 8,500-year-old Neolithic site of Mehrgarh in
        Balochistan,[19] the Indus Valley civilisation of the Bronze Age, the most extensive of the civilisations of the
        Afro-Eurasia,[20][21] and the ancient Gandhara civilization.[22] The region that comprises the modern state of
        Pakistan was the realm of multiple empires and dynasties, including the Achaemenid; briefly that of Alexander the
        Great; the Seleucid, the Maurya, the Kushan, the Gupta;[23] the Umayyad Caliphate in its southern regions, the Hindu
        Shahis, the Ghaznavids, the Delhi Sultanate, the Mughals,[24] the Durranis, the Sikh Empire, British East India
        Company rule, and most recently, the British Indian Empire from 1858 to 1947</p>

    <p>Pakistan is a middle power nation,[28][29][30][31][32][33] and has the world's sixth-largest standing armed forces.
        It is a declared nuclear-weapons state, and is ranked amongst the emerging and growth-leading economies,[34] with a
        large and rapidly-growing middle class.[35] Pakistan's political history since independence has been characterised
        by periods of significant economic and military growth as well as those of political and economic instability. It is
        an ethnically and linguistically diverse country, with similarly diverse geography and wildlife. The country
        continues to face challenges, including poverty, illiteracy, corruption and terrorism.[36] Pakistan is a member of
        the United Nations, the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation, the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation, the Commonwealth
        of Nations, the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation, and the Islamic Military Counter-Terrorism
        Coalition, and is designated as a major non-NATO ally by the United States</p>

<p>Spurred by the Pakistan Movement, which sought a homeland for the Muslims of British India, and election victories in
    1946 by the All-India Muslim League, Pakistan gained independence in 1947 after the Partition of the British Indian
    Empire, which awarded separate statehood to its Muslim-majority regions and was accompanied by an unparalleled mass
    migration and loss of life.[25] Initially a Dominion of the British Commonwealth, Pakistan officially drafted its
    constitution in 1956, and emerged as a declared Islamic republic. In 1971, the exclave of East Pakistan seceded as
    the new country of Bangladesh after a nine-month-long civil war. In the following four decades, Pakistan has been
    ruled by governments whose descriptions, although complex, commonly alternated between civilian and military,
    democratic and authoritarian, relatively secular and Islamist.[26] Pakistan elected a civilian government in 2008,
    and in 2010 adopted a parliamentary system with periodic elections.[27]</p>
